            <h2> What is this? </h2>
            <p>That's a great question, thanks for asking!</p>
            <p>First, some context. I started programming in the nineties, using LOGO, on a pretty old computer my school had been allocated via a government initiative. It was fun.<br>
            Then I moved on to BASIC on an IBM PS/2 during the holidays using the computer my grand-father had acquired for his retirement. That machine lived on to run my first Linux, a Debian machine that needed an ungodly amount of floppy-disks to install...<br>
            The Web had by then grown big enough to make HTML and CSS interesting to me, and when I started IT-engineering school, I got my first computer.<br>
            From then on, I've been passionate about tech. Mobile, IoT, Web, VR... I find an interest in everything, from security to DevOps through game technology and embedded devices.</p>
            <p>
            This site is a new version of the one I regularly build up from scratch. It's been built in pure HTML, with CSS, with SCSS? with JS, with TypeScript, with Bootstrap, with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, with PureCSS... This version runs the 2020 version of <a href="https://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a> and some basic TypeScript based code, a tiny amount of custom SCSS, and even more basic HTML.<br>
            It's run on-premise on physical hardware, on Gandi.org virtual machines, on Digital Ocean virtual machines and Docker images, and now it's found a new home!</p>
            <p>What interests me this time is Microsoft's <a href="azure.com">Azure</a>. Back in the late noughties, IT students like me tended to run Linux machines (or, for some rich boys and girls, Macbooks). Gamers had Windows machines, but "The Enemy" was Microsoft and their campaign against open-source.</p>
            <p>How the world has changed.</p>
            <p>I now run a Macbook Pro, and a Windows machine. My data isn't saved on floppies, USB keys and HDDs, it's not stored in zip files or tar.gz archives or SVN repositories, it relies on iCloud, GCP, AWS, Github, Bitbucket, and many more.<br>
            Microsoft has become one of the strongest allies of Open Source, and my Windows is also a Linux machine with WLS. My Mac runs Visual Studio Code. This site was built on a Mac, with Vim and Code and iTerm2 and ZSH and git.
            Yes, I have less hair now, and kids. I have less time to tinker with doomed ideas, and more need for easy options.<br>
            That's why this site is built upon Azure's storage services, and a CI/CD integration through github. It's simple, it's efficient, it builds upon YAML pipelines, Node's package.json, and the Git Flow almost every developer uses nowadays.<br>
            It's simple. It's easy. It's fast.<br>
            The little time I have to spend can be spent building things I want to build rather than writing patches for the weird combination of Nvidia GPU and Intel card in a Fujitsu-Siemens laptop running a Gentoo.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>TL:DR;</h2>
            It's an Azure-backed website that demonstrates how easy it is to build an Azure site for any semi-proficient tech.
