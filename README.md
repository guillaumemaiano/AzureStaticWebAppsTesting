## 20241028

Starting a rework of that old website.

    - Replace Skeleton.css with SemanticUI.css
    - Update Azure deployment mechanics
    - Update TypeScript mechanics
    - Modernize the looks to something more 2024

### Practice

    - Using feature branches
    - Using fonts and images
    - Using AI and development VMs

### Known issues

    - Background and footer seem broken
    - Glass effect doesn't work well (or at all)

### Desired features

    - Keep some version of the CSS pong ball in the previous site
    - Add more cool CSS effects (hover, overlay)
